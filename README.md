This is a working directory which will store important steps for a data-engineering mini project, whose scope is mentioned below:

<ol>
<li>Prepare a dummy data in my-sql locally, Move this data from local to [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/).</li>
<li>Use [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) to perform an ETL, source: Above RDS, Destination: Some Table in same db, or else another RDS.</li>
<li>Again, use AWS Glue to move that data between source: Above RDS, destination: [AWS Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/)</li>
</ol>
